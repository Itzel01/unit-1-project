                    <p> 
                        Our mission is to provide the information that an undocumented 
                        person may need. Provide them with organizations that could help 
                        them get citizenship or even defend them if they ever need it. 
                        Our mission is to educate people who may not know what it is like 
                        to be undocumented so they won't judge people before they have even
                        met them. We want to create a website where people can go and 
                        learn, where people who haven't found a community can hopefully find one
                        with the resources we have provided. If they don't know if they can 
                        apply for citizenship, our hope is that they can talk to a lawyer, 
                        free of cost and weigh their own indiviual options.

                    <h3 class="title"> Who is an "Undocumented Immigrant"? </h3>
                    <p>
                        An Undocumented Immigrant is a person who is foreign born and has
                        no legal right to be or remain in their country of residence. In the United States,
                        there is a common misconception is that almost all undocumented immigrants
                        are those that crossed the US-Mexico border. While there are indeed 
                        a large number of people who have crossed the border, there is an even larger group 
                        of tourists and travellers from many countries who simply overstayed their visas.

                    <h3 class="title"> Emotional Baggage </h3>
                    <p>
                        There is so much emotional baggage that comes with being undocumented.
                        There are people who live in constant fear of deportation. People who 
                        used to be so proud of being bilingual and proud of their culture 
                        are now terrified to even speak their native tongues. This is due to the 
                        huge amount of harrassment that they have experienced throughout the years 
                        of living in the United States. They are so used to being told that they 
                        aren't enough that they actually begin to believe it. Some experience the homesickness
                        that comes everytime they talk to family at home. As much as they would happily
                        want to go back, they know that they came for a reason, and 
                        that is to seek greater opportunities and quality of life for themselves and their family. 
                        They fought hard to get to the States, all in search of the American Dream.

                    <h3 class="title"> A Day In Their Life... </h3>
                    <p>
                        A day in the life of an undocumented person may look similiar to that
                        of the average citizen, except that their job likely 
                        pays them less than minimum wage and they make a concerted effort to avoid interactions 
                        with authority at all costs. The reason why they accept the less than minimum 
                        wage is because their employers often take advantage of their status. 
                        An undocumented person may just feel lucky to have even been hired. 
                        They fear authority because there is already so much racial bias 
                        and prejudice in our nation's leadership, that if they are identified as 
                        undocumented, there is a chance that they may even be deported. 
                        Deportation is something that many of these people fear and avoid at all costs.
