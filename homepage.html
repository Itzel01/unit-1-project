                    An Undocumented Immigrant is a person who is foreign born and has
                    no legal right to be or remain in the United States. Some misconceptions 
                    are that Undocumented Immigrants all crossed the border. This is not true. 
                    There is a large number of people who cross the border but there is 
                    also a large number of tourist and travellers who have simply overstayed 
                    their visa or their visa expired.

                <p>
                    There is so much emotional baggage that comes with being undocumented.
                    There are people who live in constant fear of deportation. People who 
                    used to be so proud of being bilingual and proud of their culture 
                    are now terrified to even speak their native tongues. This is due to the 
                    huge amount of harrassment that they have experienced throughout the years 
                    of living in the United States. They are so used to being told that they 
                    aren't enough that they actually begin to believe it. There is the homesickness
                    that comes everytime you call your family and they ask how are you. 
                    You may want to cry and go home but you can't because you worked so hard to 
                    even get here, worked to live in the States, in search of the American Dream.
