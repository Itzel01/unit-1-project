                <p> 
                    Our mission is to provide the information that an undocumented 
                    person may need. Provide them with organizations that could help 
                    them get citizenship or even defend them if they ever need it. 
                    Our mission is to educate people who may not know what it is like 
                    to be undocumented so they won't judge people before they have even
                    met them.

                <p>
                    An Undocumented Immigrant is a person who is foreign born and has
                    no legal right to be or remain in the United States. Some misconceptions 
                    are that Undocumented Immigrants all crossed the border. This is not true. 
                    There is a large number of people who cross the border but there is 
                    also a large number of tourist and travellers who have simply overstayed 
                    their visa or their visa expired.

                <p>
                    There is so much emotional baggage that comes with being undocumented.
                    There are people who live in constant fear of deportation. People who 
                    used to be so proud of being bilingual and proud of their culture 
                    are now terrified to even speak their native tongues. This is due to the 
                    huge amount of harrassment that they have experienced throughout the years 
                    of living in the United States. They are so used to being told that they 
                    aren't enough that they actually begin to believe it. There is the homesickness
                    that comes everytime you call your family and they ask how are you. 
                    You may want to cry and go home but you can't because you worked so hard to 
                    even get here, worked to live in the States, in search of the American Dream.

                <h3 class="title"> A day in their life... </h3>
                <p>
                    A day in the life of an undocumented person may look exactly 
                    like the day of a documented person except their job probably 
                    pays them less than minimum wage and they will avoid interactions 
                    with authority at all costs. SO actually not at all like the day of 
                    a documented person. The reason why they accept the less than minimum 
                    wage is because their emplyers may take advantage of their status. 
                    An Undocumneted person may just feel Lucky to have even been hired. 
                    They fear authority because there is already so much racial bias 
                    and if they get caught being undocumented, there is a chance that 
                    they may even be deported. Deportation is something that many people fear 
                    and avoid at all costs.
