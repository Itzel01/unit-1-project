                            could be detained and deported.

                        place broad restrictions on certain immigration groups.

                        Asian country that immigrants were allowed to pass from. This was

                        This quota was biased and allowed a lot of white people to enter the 
                        United States legally. This Act Completely left out Asian immigrants.

            <!--Stereotypes-->
                <h1 class="title"> Stereotypes: The Unoffical History Teacher </h1>
                <p>
                    Stereotypes are ideas or images that are often oversimplified constructs or representation 
                    of someone or something. There are many stereotypes spread by media, politicians and most citizens 
                    surrounding our undocumented community. Some of these stereotypes have been around for 
                    decades while others newer and shaped by our recent socio-political climate. One such stereotype that 
                    has been sweeping the American public is that immigrants are 
                    criminals who immigrated to pollute and endanger the American populace. 
                    This is in no small part due to the political rhetoric the Trump Adminstration
                    has been promoting. Many people also would suspect a person of Latinx or a Middle 
                    Eastern heritage of being undocumented. In reality, there are also a large amount of 
                    Europeans, Asians and West Indians that are undocumented as well. Another stereotype that people have used
                    to brand others as undocumented is to scrutinize the job they have. If you are working as a gardener 
                    or nanny, you are more suspected of being undocumented. It is important to bring awareness to these 
                    stereotypes because there is a misconception of what the undocumented community actually looks like. 
                    If people have this misconceptions, there may be a lot of undocumented people looking for help 
                    but because they are "white-passing" they may not recieve the help they need.
